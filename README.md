# Tarot-Card-layouts
The tarot card program runs along with a web interface connected through the eel module. The program uses three different styles of tarot cards and gives user the option to select any of the tarot card layout. To add in some extra randomness for shuffling the cards, the script uses quantum random module as well as certain arbitrary calculations.
